Shared Dependencies:

1. **manifest.json**: This file will contain the metadata for the extension, including the manifest version, name, description, permissions, and scripts. It will reference "popup.html", "popup.js", and "background.js".

2. **popup.html**: This file will contain the HTML structure of the popup window. It will include id names for DOM elements that JavaScript functions will use. For example, it might include an id like "bitcoinPrice" for displaying the current bitcoin price.

3. **popup.css**: This file will contain the CSS styles for the popup window. It will reference the same id names defined in "popup.html" to apply styles to specific elements.

4. **popup.js**: This file will contain the JavaScript code for the popup window. It will use the id names defined in "popup.html" to manipulate DOM elements. It might include functions like "updatePrice" to update the displayed bitcoin price.

5. **background.js**: This file will contain the JavaScript code that runs in the background. It might include functions like "fetchPrice" to fetch the current bitcoin price from an API. It will communicate with "popup.js" using message passing, with message names like "priceUpdate".

6. **API Key**: Both "popup.js" and "background.js" will need to use the same API key to fetch the current bitcoin price from an API.

7. **Permissions**: Both "manifest.json" and "background.js" will need to specify the same permissions, such as "http://*/*", "https://*/*", and "activeTab", to allow the extension to fetch data from the internet and interact with the active tab.

8. **Event Listeners**: Both "popup.js" and "background.js" will need to use the same event names, such as "onClicked" and "onUpdated", to respond to user interactions and changes in the bitcoin price.
